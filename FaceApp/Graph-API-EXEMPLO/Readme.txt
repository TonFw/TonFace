Facebook recently updated their PHP-SDK to version 3.0. This is a major change. So I decided to update some of my facebook related tutorials with updated code.

At first I want to tell you that, this post is the updated version of my popular post Graph API & IFrame Base Facebook Application Development . So if you never saw that tutorial I request you to visit that and learn the basic things specially facebook application setup. Also on that post I mentioned some important things regarding iframe, so in this post I’ll not mention them again.

So in this updated post we will learn:

    How to update facebook php sdk 3.0 library
    Authentication
    How to give extended permissions
    How to call graph api
    How to publish stream using facebook’s latest dialog system
    How to request/invite your friends and track them
